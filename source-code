After opening the p drawer:
	say "[first time]I must stress that I am not the type to snoop through anyone's affairs[unicode 8212]even on investigations, I despised doing so, and found it unbecoming of a gentleman. However, Poirot had never seemed to mind my handling of his belongings (as long as it did not disturb his precious order too severely), and it did not feel as though anything in the flat was truly meant to be off-limits to me. With this reasoning in mind, [only]I gingerly opened the desk's [dynamic name of the p drawer], revealing a [dynamic name of the h spare key] and a [dynamic name of the file folder].";

The description of Hercule Poirot is "[one of]Poirot and I were a study in contrasts. The man was no taller than five feet, five inches, and had always possessed a delicately plump frame (which had grown slightly plumper of late, to his dismay). His attire was unapologetically foreign and dandified, subject at all times to his mania for neatness. He was by turns coolly commanding and demonstrative to an embarrassing degree. In spite of our many differences, we had become the dearest of friends in the pursuit of our shared interest in detection.[or]To speak of Poirot without mentioning his luxuriant moustaches is to commit a grave omission. He was inordinately proud of them, keeping them trimmed and pomaded in a supremely symmetrical manner. His black hair, which nowadays had mostly receded to the sides of his head and was slicked back gracefully, had also once been parted right down the middle. It could be difficult to take my friend seriously when his primness and vanity were manifesting in full force[unicode 8212]however, I had come to realize that he actually preferred to be underestimated, and deemed it a valuable tactical advantage.[or]Whiskers aside, another noteworthy feature of Poirot's was his hazel eyes, which at times appear to shine bright green[unicode 8212]most frequently when seizing onto something significant, and sometimes accompanied by an enigmatic Cheshire-cat smile. It could be quite disarming to be the focus of his piercing gaze.[or]My friend’s hands have often captivated me. Their steadiness was such that he could easily build card houses a dozen stories high, and his sleight of hand never failed to amaze us all. He gestured with them eloquently whenever he was excited or agitated, and connected their legendary exactitude to a corresponding precision of the brain[unicode 8212]a common theme with Poirot.[or]I took a closer look at what my friend was currently wearing[unicode 8212]a dark waistcoat over a white high-collared shirt, a paisley bowtie, perfectly-pressed trousers, and his distinctive patent-leather shoes with spats. He also wore a few gleaming accessories[unicode 8212]an ornate signet ring on his little finger, a pair of sapphire cufflinks (a recent birthday present from myself), and a pocket-watch on a chain which was a family heirloom and very precious to him.[or]Poirot noticed me staring at him and stared back for a moment, looking bemused. I flustered and averted my gaze.[or]I kept my gaze carefully averted from Poirot for now, not wishing to embarrass myself further.[stopping]".

The description of Thomas Hastings is "My firstborn child, already twelve years old. He was growing into a fine young man, though he still had the soft voice and endearing earnestness of a boy, and in recent months he had been particularly eager to take up the 'family business' of detection. I had already identified in him a great potential for managing the finances and operation of our ranch in the Argentine[unicode 8212]before we had decided to sell it after all[unicode 8212]but the keen intellect he was demonstrating in other pursuits had astounded me.".

The description of Grace Hastings is "My eldest daughter Grace was only a year younger than Thomas and was quickly becoming a gracious young lady, as befit her name. She always kept her light brown hair in plaited pigtails. I recalled with deep emotion how her mother used to tie it for her every morning, and could hardly believe that only a few years had passed since then. She now drew great pride and a certain girlish enthusiasm from tying it by herself and generally taking care of her own grooming. On occasion, when Poirot was available, she liked to have him do her hair instead[unicode 8212]he was surprisingly proficient at braiding, having apparently learned by performing the service regularly as a child for his little sister Yvonne. The result was always impeccably even and tidy, to Grace's delight, and Poirot seemed to find the delicate and repetitive work soothing.".

The description of Robert Hastings is "Whereas my eldest son Thomas wholly took after Cinders in appearance, Robert was like a miniature version of myself, from his fair hair and blue eyes to his mild but reactive disposition. Our only major point of difference was his intense fear of horses, developed after an unfortunate accident on the ranch which thankfully caused no other lasting harm. I still dreamt of taking him riding someday and had not yet given up hope.".

The description of Judith Hastings is "The youngest of the family, Judith, was a dark child in looks as well as personality. Secretly I held a special fondness for her, though I did not understand her in the least. She had been the slowest to warm up to Poirot[unicode 8212]then had begun to quibble with him with increasing frequency[unicode 8212]and nowadays they appeared to have reached a sort of amicable understanding. In one another they had found their match in terms of being secretive and obstinate (I will at least admit to the latter tendency in myself)."

The description of Miss Lemon is "Efficient and serious to a fault, Miss Felicity Lemon was Poirot's secretary, loyal to her filing system first and to him second. She had a somewhat plain but pleasantly professional appearance. Poirot had hired her during my absence and had nothing but praise for her performance[unicode 8212]he only bemoaned her lack of imagination or curiosity. I had found an unlikely friend in her and enjoyed her occasional dry wit.".

The description of the housekeeper is "Our housekeeper was Miss Annie Pearson[unicode 8212]no relation to Mrs. Pearson, the landlady Poirot and I had when we took up rooms together after our wartime reunion. Annie was actually a close relative of George, Poirot's distinguished former valet, who now held a very prestigious post on my friend's recommendation. She worked for us part-time, providing a range of general services, and typically went home later in the day to care for her aging mother.".

The description of Bob is "Bob was a lively wire-haired terrier with a mostly white coat and a wonderful temperament. He had formerly belonged to Miss Arundell, a prospective client who had sadly been murdered before Poirot and I ever received her missive. Poirot had been offered the opportunity to keep Bob, but it was ultimately I who stepped in and took over his care[unicode 8212]I have always adored dogs and understand them better than most. His unstintingly cheerful and affectionate presence had been a balm for all of us.".

Also of note were Poirot's many mufflers, which he was wont to wrap himself in at the first sign of chill.".

The description of the walking stick is "A dark and sleek stick topped with a beautiful silver swan. I had been saddened to see Poirot limping badly upon our reunion at Styles, walking up the village path with his cane in hand. Thankfully, it later became apparent that the injury was only temporary, and that my little friend could still be as spry as ever when he was roused[unicode 8212]though he tended towards slowness and sedentarity anyway, preferring to exert only his brain when possible. He took his walking-stick everywhere he went and considered it an essential part of his elegant presentation.".

Understand "swan" and "silver" and "cane" and "dark" and "sleek" as the walking stick.



Chapter 2 - Poirot Kitchen

The description of the p apron is "I have always known Poirot to be a masterful cook; lately, he had been honing his skills with particular zeal by cooking dinner on most nights, and appeared determined to outdo himself at every opportunity. He was on a mission to render even the most dubious of Belgian dishes somehow palatable to young children. He sometimes spoke fondly of his mother as he explained a recipe's origins, offering us glimpses into a past which he had been reticent about for as long as I have known him.".

The description of the p cabinets is "Poirot's cabinets contained all manner of fine glassware and china, and the pantries held enough ingredients to feed a small army. Everything was sorted impeccably according to Poirot's very particular logic.".

Understand "china", "glassware" and "ingredients" as the p cabinets.

The description of the coffee maker is "A gleaming metallic contraption which Poirot had purchased on special order from an Italian inventor, and which contained a state-of-the-art steamless mechanism. Poirot was a consummate gourmet and often went to great lengths for the sake of his palate. For my part, I have never been very choosey when it comes to coffee[unicode 8212]and in any case I preferred even the bitterest of coffees to the disgustingly thick drinking chocolate which Poirot was fond of[unicode 8212]but I had been pleasantly surprised upon tasting the difference.".


The description of the mixing bowl is "I glanced inside the bowl sitting near Poirot, which was being used to mix some sort of sauce. The appetizing smell made me impatient for dinner.".

The description of the paper note is "[if the paper note is satisfied]A handwritten note from Poirot letting me know not to wait for him this morning.[else]A handwritten note, probably left by Poirot[unicode 8212]I thought I recognized his elegant penmanship.[end if]".

The description of the p refrigerator is "Thanks to Poirot's extraordinary professional success, as well as my own respectable savings, we had been able to afford some of the most advanced devices of the time. The refrigerator was a marvel of technology and I already struggled to imagine life without it.[paragraph break]My friend's eating habits were still as queer as ever; for breakfast, alongside his drinking chocolate and the occasional French pastry, he typically had toast made from a square loaf of bread[unicode 8212]which he then cut into smaller, perfectly even squares[unicode 8212]and two eggs which must be of the exact same size. His grocer had taken to sorting out a special box of matched eggs, for which Poirot has been immensely grateful.".

".

The description of the filing system is "The minute details of Poirot's every case were stored in Miss Lemon's comprehensive filing system, which is her pride and joy. She happily turned up even on weekends to ensure everything was in order.[paragraph break]Since my return, I had seen Poirot steadily become a lot more selective with his cases. He still delighted in tackling those particularly thorny mysteries which stimulated his 'little grey cells', and maintained a steady income through solving problems for influential or high-paying clients[unicode 8212]on occasion he also acted out of pity, helping a victim whose situation appeared hopeless[unicode 8212]but on the whole he turned down many more cases than he accepted, kept significantly reduced office hours, and more often than not acted purely as a consultant.[paragraph break]Owing to this new state of affairs, Miss Lemon did not have enough work to fill her days (nor enough new material to expand and refine her beloved system), and was growing restless. Poirot and I had encouraged her to seek part-time employment elsewhere, which she had done successfully; having a whole new filing system to elaborate seemed to bring her no end of pleasure.".


The description of the handbag is "Far be it from me to scrutinize a lady's belongings[unicode 8212]still, I could not help but notice that Miss Lemon's handbag was brand new and rather fancy. While Poirot was not stingy with his employees, I wondered if perhaps her second employer sought to seduce her with better pay.".

The description of the shorthand pad is "The shorthand pad was an integral part of Miss Lemon's arsenal, and I had often been impressed by the ease and speed with which she condensed complex instructions into a mere handful of symbols.".

Understand "symbols" and "short" and "handful of symbols" as the shorthand pad.

The description of the statuette is "An elegant carved statuette of a cat which Poirot had brought back as a souvenir of our trip to Egypt. Miss Lemon was terribly fond of cats and owned a few herself[unicode 8212]which is how she came to meet the veterinarian who she now worked for when she was not needed by Poirot. The man had apparently saved the life of one of her kittens and she was extremely fond of him. Designing a system to organize the files of feline patients of various breeds, she told me, was even more satisfying than sorting our own human clients.".

The description of the typewriter is "At one time in my life, I had been employed as a private secretary to a member of Parliament, before moving on to work for Lloyd's of London. I was therefore accustomed to the use of typewriters and considered myself quite proficient. Miss Lemon's mastery of them was on an entirely different level, however, and put my own typing skill to shame.".

Understand "keys" and "typing" as the typewriter.

The description of the sliding wind is "Through the sliding window I could see Poirot's combined dining room and study[if Hercule Poirot is in Poirot Kitchen or Hercule Poirot is in Poirot Bedroom], which were currently empty[else]. Poirot sat at his desk, speaking animatedly on the telephone[end if].".


The description of the zodiac charts is "Miss Lemon prides herself on her encyclopedic knowledge of nearly any subject[unicode 8212]a skill which Poirot has made use of more than once. One of her only weak points, I came to learn, was the intricacies of the mystical and esoteric systems which are not well understood by science. In recent months we had been learning together about mediumship, hypnosis, forms of divination such as the tarot and [italic type]I Ching[roman type], and zodiacs both eastern and western. I found it all endlessly fascinating, though the eerieness of certain practices sometimes unsettled me.".


Chapter 4 - Poirot Hallway Mid

Chapter 5 - Hastings Bedroom



The description of the h bed is "Ever since the war, I have suffered from a recurrence of horrific nightmares and unwelcome visions from the trenches. Habituated to my wife's reassuring presence upon waking from these dreams, and being now deprived of it, I had badly struggled to adjust. Poirot was a light sleeper and would check on me when I tossed and turned too violently, which had been an unexpected relief.".


The description of the car guide is "Poirot had pulled out this magazine guide on my birthday only weeks prior to seek my opinion on his top choices before placing an order. He himself had sold his Messaro-Gratz in the previous year for a pretty penny[unicode 8212]in favour of a more practical and less ostentatious vehicle which we both made use of[unicode 8212]and he knew of my own hopes of someday getting back into competitive motoring.[paragraph break]Upon presentation of the guide he had called my attention to the newest supercharged Alta two-seater, excitedly boasting of its one hundred and eighty 'horse-vapours', and I was admittedly awed by the list of specifications. I had insisted it was too extravagant a present but I was privately glad for Poirot's stubbornness, as I had terribly missed the sport and was eager to practise it once more.".


The description of the writing desk is "The desk on which I wrote the better part of this very story, and on which I hope to write many more in the future. In documenting Poirot's cases, I had discovered a hidden passion for the art, and enjoyed it immensely. I sometimes liked to work in my friend's sitting room, in the family flat, or in some [italic type]café[roman type] or another[unicode 8212]but when I needed peace and stillness, I sought refuge here.".

The description of the notebook is "I had started keeping notes about the puzzles and solutions of various mysteries in an attempt to gain a better understanding of Poirot's methods[unicode 8212]an initiative which had met with my friend's warm approval. Poirot took relatively few cases nowadays and so my notebook had not seen as much use as I would have liked, but I still enjoyed jotting down thoughts and observations whenever we had investigative discussions.".


The description of the h picture of Cinderella is "Dulcie Hastings, [italic type]née[roman type] Duveen, a professional acrobat whom Poirot and I had met while investigating a case in France. To me she had always been Cinderella, and indeed ours had been a fairytale romance. She had been the sweetest and truest wife a man could have. That she had been snuffed out barely at mid-life was to me the height of unfairness, and there were still times when I would suddenly experience that fearsome rush of grief and anger all over again.[paragraph break]My only comfort was that she died, as she would have wished, with no drawn out suffering from illness or old age. But the deep loneliness created by her passing left me lost and homesick, and in the end[unicode 8212]after arranging her final resting place, in a beautiful and peaceful location which I know she would have approved of[unicode 8212]I made the difficult decision to come back to England.".

Poirot did not share my enthusiasm for either activity, and was particularly doubtful of the former, but he did not nag me much unless he feared I was making a truly ruinous investment. I would often sit in his study, on mornings where he was not otherwise engaged, and read aloud to him from sensational headlines in the [italic type]Daily Newsmonger[roman type] or the [italic type]Daily Blare[roman type] just like old days.".

Understand "stocks" and "results" and "match results" and "cricket" and "investments" and "headlines" and "daily newsmonger" and "daily blare" as the newspaper.

Chapter 7 - Poirot Hallway End

Chapter 8 - Poirot Bedroom



The description of the p bed is "Of a good size and very comfortable, like mine.

Understand "bedclothes" as the p bed.

The description of Cedric is "A stuffed caiman, brought as a present for Poirot during one of my visits home from South America to conduct business relating to the ranch. I shot the beast on the Orinoco, in Venezuela, and was quite proud of my feat. Poirot, despite his claims to the contrary, was perturbed by the strong chemical smell which had lingered far beyond the time frame given to me by the taxidermist. I had resigned myself to seeing old Cedric relegated to the back of a closet, but had been pleasantly surprised to find him in his place of honour on Poirot's dresser upon my return.".


The description of the family photograph is "One of the first photographs shot with our Kodak, some time after we settled in. It shows Poirot, the children and myself[unicode 8212]along with Bob, who could not sit still and came out slightly blurred[unicode 8212]arranged around my living room with joyous expressions as we posed for the camera. The sight of the great Hercule Poirot in his shirtsleeves, a small child on each knee, never failed to amuse and gladden me!".

The description of the slippers is "Poirot, in his dandyish and self-admiring manner, loved to have his most luxurious personal items inscribed with his elegant monogram of an intertwined H and P. He sometimes wore these dark velvety slippers around the house after his bath, when the day's schedule allowed him to keep a casual presentation. I confess that the aches of advancing middle age were making me crave comforts that I had spurned as a younger man, and I was tempted to procure some slippers of my own.".

The description of the p wardrobe is "Poirot's well-stocked wardrobe contained, among other things, ornate smoking jackets and a sea of bowties.".



Chapter 9 - Poirot Study




The description of the ashtray is "Both Poirot and I smoked cigarettes[unicode 8212]his were tiny and Continental[unicode 8212]and I was also partial to pipe-smoking. In recent years there had been some talk among doctors as to the potential harms of tobacco use, and we successfully cut back on our consumption by common agreement. But even Poirot, for all his vaunted self-control, struggled to kick the habit entirely[unicode 8212]I'm afraid I did not fare much better.".

Understand "cigarettes" and "pipe" and "tobacco" as the ashtray.

The description of the p bookshelf is "[if the clue is satisfied and the clue is unseen]     Something about Poirot's bookcase caught my eye, but I could not immediately identify what it was. There were no obvious gaps in the books. Not a speck of dust to be seen, as usual. Then it struck me at once: the Poirot novels were all in a jumble! Instead of being neatly sorted by height, they were now arranged in a totally chaotic order.
[paragraph break]     'Eureka!' I ejaculated, startling Thomas who rushed to join me in examining the books. Said ejaculation had sadly been premature, however. I did not have the faintest idea who could have done this or why[unicode 8212]furthermore, I could not understand how Thomas and I had missed all this disorder during our earlier visits to the room. The boy was at present stroking his chin pensively, a deep furrow creasing his brow.
[end if]
[if the clue is satisfied and the clue is seen and the player is not eveninged]Poirot's bookcase held tomes of all kinds, most of which were of the detective genre. Among the titles were [italic type]The Leavenworth Case[roman type], [italic type]Arsène Lupin: gentleman cambrioleur[roman type], [italic type]Le mystère de la chambre jaune[roman type], [italic type]The Cask[roman type], [italic type]The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes[roman type][unicode 8212]and, notably, the works of Ariadne Oliver. She is a friend of ours and a fellow author, though her stories are fictional rather than biographical and center an eccentric Finnish detective.[paragraph break]Of course, my own writings featured prominently on the shelves, alongside those of other men who have accompanied Poirot on cases in my absence. Everything was there, from my earliest publications in [italic type]The Sketch[roman type] to all the full-length books that followed, and even their French translations. Poirot often complained about what he saw as the capital crime of publishers[unicode 8212]not sticking to a unified format[unicode 8212]and had endeavoured to sort his own collection by height. [line break]However, the order of the books had now been jumbled, and it fell to me to deduce the culprit. My attempt to gather clues by examining them further sadly proved fruitless.

He would respond with affected affront belied by a fond twinkle in his eye, which invariably only intensified the children's giggling. I could not help agreeing with their assessment[unicode 8212]my friend has always shown a distinctly feline manner and temper.[paragraph break]Grace had handed her present to Poirot bashfully, apologizing for its lopsidedness.

The description of the p bathtub is "I had initially had doubts about the 'modern' styling of Whitehaven Mansions and its furnishings, as I associated the term with cheap decor and flimsy, insubstantial objects; a far cry from the durable and traditionally charming furniture I had grown accustomed to. I had been happily surprised to find in this flat a reasonable compromise between old-fashioned philosophies and modern enhancements, and the sturdy, elegant bathtub was a shining example of the former. We planned to install a shower-head onto the tub[unicode 8212]I had had the opportunity to shower on several occasions in the past, but never with warm water, and was eagerly looking forward to it.".

The description of the Revivit is "For a few years Poirot's hair had been growing greyer from visit to visit, until suddenly becoming jet-black once again; he had shocked me by revealing[unicode 8212]in his typical jestful and circumspect manner[unicode 8212]that he was now dyeing it. I did not fall in with his particular brand of vanity and was unwilling to resort to these kinds of tricks myself, but my own thinning and greying hair nonetheless distressed me. I felt it was unfair that I should be the only one showing these signs of aging, and looking worse off by way of comparison. I wondered if by making a convincing case I could entice Poirot to abandon the product!".

The description of the p sink is "I have always been too tall to use most sinks without having to stoop terribly; this one was sadly no exception.".

The description of the p toiletries is "On our shelves were a variety of hygiene products, including my English Fern aftershave and Poirot's cologne [italic type]Pour un homme[roman type].

Part 2 - Objects

Chapter 1 - Hastings Entrance



The description of the h closet is "The closet currently housed the children's winter clothes, as well as hobby-horses and a few other toys which had previously been cluttering their bedrooms. I had no need to concern myself with it to-day.".

The description of the h door is "I could go out the front door to access the building's hall and head up to Poirot's flat.".

The description of the h stand is "The stand typically bore a few clothes belonging to the children and to Miss Pearson, as well as a mackintosh[if the mackintosh is leashed] (currently on my person) which[end if] I kept on hand for days like to-day. The hat portion did not see much use, for the time being[unicode 8212] I looked forward to passing on some of my own fashions to the boys once they were grown.".

The description of the h lavatory is "The lavatory had been invaluable for the family due to the logistical challenges of four children sharing a single bathroom. I did not currently pay it much mind[unicode 8212]it was primarily used in emergencies when the the bathroom was occupied.".

The description of the leash is "Bob's favourite object in the world, after his food bowl. He had quickly learned to associate it with walks and often took it upon himself to make sure we remembered our duties.".


Chapter 2 - Hastings Kitchen


The description of the h apron is "This kitchen was hardly ever used by anyone other than Miss Pearson, though Grace had recently exhibited a growing interest in learning to cook and sometimes shadowed her nanny. Once Poirot learned of her ambitions, I had no doubt he would insist on taking her under his wing.".

The description of the h cabinets is "Our cabinets were not nearly as well-organized as Poirot's, and our dishes, though of great quality, were of the more plain and hardy variety.".

The description of the dishes is "[if the housekeeper is visible]Miss Pearson was helpfully doing the dishes[else]The dishes had already been put away[end if].".


The description of the h refrigerator is "Thanks to Poirot's immense professional success, as well as my own respectable savings, we had been able to afford some of the most advanced devices of the time. The refrigerator was a marvel of technology and I already struggled to imagine life without it.".

The description of the sandwiches is "Miss Pearson had prepared these for the children[unicode 8212]she habitually made light meals for them throughout the day. [if the sandwiches is satisfied]I was now pleasantly full, but felt a gluttonous inclination to have more[else]Having not had breakfast or lunch yet, I felt peckish, and was inclined to sample them[end if].".

Chapter 3 - Spare Room

The description of the sp furniture is "I did not like to poke about Miss Pearson's rooms[unicode 8212]it felt ungentlemanly.".

The description of the sp curtain is "The sliding window to the family dining room was covered by a curtain for privacy.".


Chapter 4 - Hastings Hallway Mid

Chapter 5 - Girls Bedroom



The description of the artistic materials is "Grace possessed a romantic and artistic temperament, and spent most of her free time practising various crafts. Recently she had taken to knitting, after Miss Lemon generously donated some of her own supplies[if Grace Hastings is in Hastings Dining Room]. Her latest project sat on the dresser, filled with pins marking her progress[end if].".

The description of the chemistry sets is "Judith's uncommonly keen interest in chemistry only seemed to intensify with every new set we gifted her. A few months prior, around Christmas-time, she had come to us requesting more advanced material. I was inclined to accept, having already begun to make peace with my daughter's peculiarities; Poirot, about as old-fashioned as I am but lacking the child-rearing delicacy which my late wife imparted to me, had blundered into a minor confrontation.[paragraph break][italic type]'But Judith, it is not healthy for a young lady to spend so much time with the test tubes! See you, it is important to learn other skills also[unicode 8212]like the cooking, for when you have a husband to feed.'[paragraph break][roman type]When she suggested defiantly that she might not want to marry, Poirot delivered scandalized exhortations[unicode 8212]which fell on deaf ears. Though I could understand my friend's reasoning and did not entirely disagree, it seemed somewhat hypocritical for a confirmed bachelor like himself to be touting the benefits of marriage. I could plainly see that Judith shared my thoughts. With startling suddenness she changed her tack.[italic type][paragraph break]'Then I shall marry a scientist, like Marie Curie did, and we'll hire a cook. Or[unicode 8212]or I'll find a husband who cooks and tidies like you, Uncle Hercule! I only hope he'll do those things as well as you can...'[paragraph break]What a masterful [italic type]coup de grâce[roman type]! I had had to hide my beaming face behind my newspaper. Flattery has always been Poirot's weak point, and Judith was not shy about appealing to his vanity. He inevitably wound up indulging her and never seemed to begrudge her getting the upper hand. That time had been no exception, and I have not heard further complaints regarding the chemistry sets.".

The description of the dolls is "Grace's collection mixed traditional porcelain dolls with modern composition toys. This past Christmas, Poirot and I had gifted her a model that could close her eyes and even cry[unicode 8212]to Poirot's great relief, not loudly enough to be heard from his flat on the upper floor!".

The description of the g beds is "Although Miss Pearson was available and willing to make the beds regularly, I preferred to entrust that task to the children themselves. Becoming a widower had impressed upon me the value of self-sufficiency.".

The description of the g dresser is "On the dresser were tidy piles of [dynamic name of the artistic materials] and boxed [dynamic name of the chemistry sets].".

The description of the g picture of Cinderella is "One of my greatest fears after the loss of my wife was of the girls being left without a female presence in their lives. It had been a great relief to see Grace bond with both Miss Lemon and Miss Pearson, but I could not stop worrying about Judith[unicode 8212]Judith, with her fierce temper, her tendency to keep her own counsel which had so often made me feel slighted, and her complete lack of interest in the usual feminine pursuits. At those times I tried my best to keep Cinderella's words of advice in mind, and carry on her spirit and wisdom. She had shared my concerns about Judith's  intensity of feeling and queerness of character, but insisted that our children should be allowed to make their own choices and mistakes. I tried to trust in our daughter and avoid smothering her at all costs.".

The description of the g supplies is "In terms of schooling and career paths, Judith was by far the most ambitious of the girls. She dreamt of going into science, applying herself to her studies with a focus and determination which went beyond her years.[paragraph break]Grace, on the other hand, was devoted to her artistic hobbies and otherwise did not seem to mind performing any type of labour. She had a marked interest in other cultures and countries and had expressed a desire to travel the world someday. To Poirot's chagrin, her fascination was extended moreso towards the Orient than the Continent, but he valiantly persisted in imparting fragments of his own culture to her and her siblings.".

Chapter 6 - Hastings Dining Room


The description of the bowls is "Always kept full by Robert, who dutifully attended to them every morning. He had been admirably eager to care for our dog and had even begun to take him on walks when circumstances permitted.".


The description of the h table is "The table on which the children had most of their meals. I habitually joined them in the morning, but they managed well with Miss Pearson's help even on days where I missed breakfast.".


The description of the d curtain is "From here I could see the sliding window connecting this room to the spare room, though a curtain blocked the view.".


The delicate pattern is a thing in Hastings Dining Room. Understand "knit", "knitting", "pattern", "delicate" and "delicate pattern" as the delicate pattern.

The description of the delicate pattern is "Grace possessed a romantic and artistic temperament, and spent most of her free time practising various crafts. Recently she had taken to knitting, after Miss Lemon generously donated some of her own supplies.".


Chapter 7 - Hastings Hallway End

Chapter 8 - Boys Bedroom


The description of the army-men is "Robert owned an entire corps of army-men of varied makes and origins[unicode 8212]from play sets, special series, even Christmas crackers[unicode 8212]and all of them were currently scattered across the room. I often had to remind him to put them away, which delighted Poirot who had often complained of my own propensity to leave things lying about.".


The description of the b beds is "Although Miss Pearson was available and willing to make the beds regularly, I preferred to entrust that task to the children themselves. Becoming a windower had impressed upon me the value of self-sufficiency.".


The description of the b dresser is "On the dresser was a [dynamic name of the stuffed rabbit] sitting atop a [dynamic name of the familiar book].".


The description of the b picture of Cinderella is "One recurring point of concern for my late wife and myself had been Robert's innocence and tenderness of feeling. While Thomas has often shown an admirable placidity and stiff-upper-lip despite his underlying earnestness, his little brother could seldom mask his emotions and consistently failed to develop any real sense of stoicism. I had myself once been a somewhat sensitive child but had quickly grown out of it, and hoped to see Robert do the same. Poirot recurringly offered me dubious compliments alluding to my supposedly transparent and 'beautiful' nature[unicode 8212]even Cinders had traitorously agreed with him at one point[unicode 8212]ridiculous and exaggerated perceptions!".


The description of the b supplies is "Robert made up his mind very early on about a career in the Royal Navy and was already champing at the bit as he waited to come of age. He admired the heroics of my younger days and the active role that I had played in bringing down several fearsome opponents. While it pleased me greatly to be looked up to, I will candidly confess that I did not think myself truly worthy of it. I had once led my men into battle with pride[unicode 8212]and even now could still muster up the requisite courage to face most varieties of danger[unicode 8212]but I had developed a sort of cowardly attitude towards military combat which saddened me deeply. I had secretly been glad to be exempted from the imminent drafts, and the thought of Robert facing similar horrors chilled me to the core.[paragraph break]As for Thomas, he was set to attend Eton just as I had. Poirot was outwardly supportive, but it was plain to me that he was actually very upset by the prospect; I suspected a combination of his mother-hen tendencies and his desire to take Thomas into his personal tutelage. I could hardly condemn his feeling[unicode 8212]the thought of separating the family even temporarily after we had suffered such a devastating loss put a significant damper on my own feelings of excitement and fatherly pride. Besides, the idea of having one of the world's finest minds bent to my son's education and training held a strong appeal. In the end, war broke out before the next school year, which cemented our decision to hold Thomas back after all.".


The description of the ball is "Bob had a habit of keeping his favourite ball in the boys[apostrophe] bedroom. The sight of it called to mind that fateful case in Market Basing which brought him into our care. There had been a theory that the victim fell down the stairs after tripping on a ball which Bob had left nearby[unicode 8212]he had ultimately been cleared, but I still thought it wise to watch my step.".


The description of the familiar book is "[one of]On giving the book a second glance, I quickly recognized it as a[or]A[stopping] copy of [italic type]The Big Four[roman type], written by myself two decades prior. My friend Mrs Oliver[unicode 8212]who is an acclaimed author of detective fiction and has offered positive critique of my accounts of Poirot's cases[unicode 8212]had shocked and saddened me by implying that this book was by far my worst. To me it seemed a faithful retelling of the most exciting and eventful adventure I have ever had with Poirot, and one where I had truly appeared at my best. I had lent Thomas my own personal copy.".


The description of the stuffed rabbit is "Robert's beloved stuffed animal, modeled after Peter Rabbit. It worried me to see him hold onto a toy like this at his age, but I continually reminded myself of Cinderella's advice not to be an overbearing parent, and tried to trust that I was bringing him up adequately enough already.".


The description of the model ships is "Robert's love of little army-men was only outmatched by his passion for ships of all kinds. In the corner of the room was the jewel of his collection[unicode 8212]a magnificient miniature sailboat, with a mast nearly as tall as I am, which Poirot and I had purchased on my sudden fancy to float a ship around park ponds as a summer pastime.  I had sadly not been able to bring it with me to the Argentine and was glad to find that my friend had kept it. The ship was still sometimes taken out for a bit of sailing, but it typically served a more decorative purpose nowadays.".
 

Chapter 9 - Hastings Study


The description of the Monopoly is "A favourite in our household[unicode 8212]each child had a lucky game piece and a preferred strategy. I fared well whenever we all played together but had managed to beat Poirot himself only once, thanks to an improbable string of disastrous dice throws on his part. The fancy-dressed and mustachioed man printed on some of the cards, who bore a striking resemblance to my friend, had been the subject of many jokes among the children[if Hercule Poirot is not in Poirot Kitchen]. At the moment they were enthusiastically playing, treating the purchase and sale of their little properties with the utmost seriousness[end if].".

The description of the games is "Card games such as cribbage and rummy had been so popular with the children that we had sought out other games for them to learn, and had now grown a respectable collection. Some favourites were draughts, chess, Jiggle-Joggle, Ludo, and of course Monopoly[if Hercule Poirot is not in Poirot Kitchen] (which was currently in use)[end if]. Miss Lemon had also recently passed on an old game titled Pank-a-Squith, which had fascinated the girls and reminded me of Cinderella's own support of women's suffrage[unicode 8212]my late wife could be remarkably passionate about these topics despite her otherwise carefree nature.".

The description of the h bookshelf is "In the bookcase was an eclectic mix of children's books[unicode 8212]a more varied and stimulating offer than I had gotten in my own childhood. Some of them were beginning to be outgrown by even the youngest of the family, while others still saw regular use. Among the many titles were [italic type]Alice's Adventures in Wonderland[roman type], [italic type]The Hobbit[roman type], [italic type]Mary Poppins[roman type], [italic type]Nancy Drew[roman type], [italic type]The Tale of Peter Rabbit[roman type], [italic type]Winnie-the-Pooh[roman type], [italic type]Fables de La Fontaine[roman type], [italic type]Contes de ma mère l'Oye[roman type], and [italic type]Pinocchio[roman type] (Poirot, being multi-lingual, had been tempted to acquire it in the original Italian[unicode 8212]but I felt that one foreign language in their education was enough for the time being). Lately my friend had also proudly introduced a few contemporary Belgian comic-books; the children were especially fond of the [italic type]Tintin[roman type] series, which featured a small dog strongly resembling Bob.".

Understand "alice", "wonderland", "adventures", "winnie", "pooh", "nancy", "drew", "pinocchio", "fables", "fontaine", "tintin", "rabbit", "peter", "hobbit", "mary", "poppins", "contes" and "oye" as the h bookshelf.

The description of the h drawer is "[if the h drawer is closed]The chest of drawers was currently closed[else]The chest of drawers was currently open, revealing a [dynamic name of the p spare key] and a [dynamic name of the photo album][end if].".

The description of the h seats is "Very comfortable seats which the children loved climbing into. Despite the housekeeper's best efforts and Bob's obedience in staying off of the chairs and sofa, they regularly amassed a covering of dog hair, to Poirot's horror.".

The description of the h wireless is "Frequently used by myself for the news, when I wasn't at Poirot's flat[unicode 8212]by Miss Pearson, who was fond of entertainment programmes[unicode 8212]or else by the children when the [italic type]Children's Hour[roman type] was on[if Hercule Poirot is in Poirot Bedroom]The wireless had been switched off for the night[else]. It was currently turned on, providing some pleasant background noise[end if].".

The description of the p spare key is "A spare key to Poirot's flat[unicode 8212]just in case.".

The description of the photo album is "Our album had filled up nicely thanks to the camera we acquired for the household, which has been used to document every major event since. In the front pages were some nostalgic older photographs[unicode 8212]a rare surviving portrait of myself as a child[unicode 8212]a few pictures from the Duveen side of the family, which included Americans and Italians[unicode 8212]images of Poirot and myself clipped from newspaper articles about our more high-profile cases[unicode 8212]and lovely shots from my wedding, where Cinders had looked radiant and effortlessly beautiful. Poirot was my best man, of course, though he was already a celebrity by then and his presence stole the show somewhat."



The description of the sports equipment is "Racquets, bats, clubs, a quaint croquet set and other assorted sporting goods were lined up against the wall. I have always been an avid player of various sports, and now more than ever encouraged frequent family outings to play all together[unicode 8212]though the bustle of London agreed with us, I was afraid the convenience of city living would make us idle and unhealthy. Poirot has always been disinclined towards strenuous activity and was reticent to participate at all; thankfully, the children's encouragement (and my own tactful suggestions that it might help his waistline) have induced him to partake in some of the milder activities. To my frustration, my friend had been blessed with a natural talent for golf, which went to waste due to his dislike of the sport which he termed 'shapeless and haphazard'.".

The description of the television is "An incredible device which the children had welcomed with no small amount of excitement. I myself had been very glad for the ability to watch the Wimbledon Championships the previous year despite having to stay home due to an ill-timed bout of fever. Recently there had been a film broadcast which featured renowned actress Mary Marvell[unicode 8212]a former client of Poirot whose case I had assisted with[unicode 8212]and I had revelled in the children's awe and wonder on learning of my past association with her. [paragraph break]Despite his stated disinterest in most of the current programming, Poirot sometimes found his way down to our flat to watch something with us. (Coincidentally, I am writing these words on the very day that our television service resumed, after a years-long wartime interruption.)[line break]".


Chapter 10 - Hastings Bathroom 



The description of the h bathtub is "The children loved the spacious bathtub, and were enthused by our plans to install shower-heads in both of the flats.".

The description of the h sink is "I have always been too tall to use most sinks without having to stoop terribly; this one was sadly no exception.".

The description of the h toiletries is "On the shelves were a variety of hygiene and oral care products.".

The description of the toothbrushes is "Poirot and I have instilled in the children a healthy fear of the dentist, which motivated them to brush their teeth conscientiously.".

The Familiar Count is a number that varies.
	
Before reading the familiar book:
	increase the Familiar Count by 1;
	if the Familiar Count is at least 11:
		say "Tempting as it was to continue reading, I decided I should take a break and go about my business." instead;
	say "[if Thomas Hastings is eveninged]I read over Thomas's shoulder.[else][one of]I picked up the book and flipped through the pages, settling on an excerpt to read.[or]Picking up the book once more, I flipped through the pages and settled on an excerpt to read.[stopping][end if][line break][italic type]";
	if the Familiar Count is 1:
		say "I had landed in France two days before, transacted some necessary business, and was now en route for London. I should be there some months[unicode 8212]time enough to look up old friends, and one old friend in particular. A little man with an egg-shaped head and hazel eyes[unicode 8212]Hercule Poirot! I proposed to take him completely by surprise. My last letter from the Argentine had given no hint of my intended voyage[unicode 8212]indeed, that had been decided upon hurriedly as a result of certain business complications[unicode 8212]and I spent many amused moments picturing to myself his delight and stupefaction on beholding me.[roman type]

		(I skimmed ahead.)

		[italic type]On arrival in London, I deposited my luggage at an hotel and drove straight on to the old address. What poignant memories it brought back to me! I hardly waited to greet my old landlady, but hurried up the stairs two at a time and rapped on Poirot's door.

		'Enter, then,' cried a familiar voice from within.

		I strode in. Poirot stood facing me. In his arms he carried a small valise, which he dropped with a crash on beholding me.

		'Mon ami, Hastings!' he cried. 'Mon ami, Hastings!'

		And, rushing forward, he enveloped me in a capacious embrace. Our conversation was incoherent and inconsequent. Ejaculations, eager questions, incomplete answers, messages from my wife, explanations as to my journey, were all jumbled up together.

		'I suppose there's some one in my old rooms?' I asked at last, when we had calmed down somewhat. 'I'd love to put up here again with you.'

		Poirot's face changed with startling suddenness.

		'Mon Dieu! but what a chance épouvantable. Regard around you, my friend.'

		For the first time I took note of my surroundings. Against the wall stood a vast ark of a trunk of prehistoric design. Near to it were placed a number of suit-cases, ranged neatly in order of size from large to small. The inference was unmistakable.

		'You are going away?'

		'Yes.'

		'Where to?'

		'South America.'

		'What?'

		'Yes, it is a droll farce, is it not? It is to Rio I go, and every day I say to myself, I will write nothing in my letters[unicode 8212]but oh! the surprise of the good Hastings when he beholds me!'";
	if the Familiar Count is 2:
		say "He pushed me into a chair.

		'Come, I will tell you how it all came about. Do you know who is the richest man in the world? Richer even than Rockefeller? Abe Ryland.'

		'The American Soap King?'

		'Precisely. One of his secretaries approached me. There is some very considerable, as you would call it, hocus-pocus going on in connection with a big company in Rio. He wished me to investigate matters on the spot. I refused. I told him that if the facts were laid before me, I would give him my expert opinion. But that he professed himself unable to do. I was to be put in possession of the facts only on my arrival out there. Normally, that would have closed the matter. To dictate to Hercule Poirot is sheer impertinence. But the sum offered was so stupendous that for the first time in my life I was tempted by mere money. It was a competence[unicode 8212]a fortune! And there was a second attraction[unicode 8212]you, my friend. For this last year and a half I have been a very lonely old man. I thought to myself, Why not? I am beginning to weary of this unending solving of foolish problems. I have achieved sufficient fame. Let me take this money and settle down somewhere near my old friend.'

		I was quite affected by this token of Poirot's regard.";
	if the Familiar Count is 3:
		say "'Put very delicately,' said Poirot, nodding his head. 'And supposing I[unicode 8212]accept?'

		'In that case I am empowered to offer you[unicode 8212]compensation.'

		He drew out a pocket-book, and threw ten notes on the table. They were for ten thousand francs each.

		'That is merely as a guarantee of our good faith,' he said. 'Ten times that amount will be paid you.'

		'Good God,' I cried, springing up, 'you dare to think[unicode 8212]!'

		'Sit down, Hastings,' said Poirot autocratically. 'Subdue your so beautiful and honest nature and sit down. To you, monsieur, I will say this. What is to prevent me ringing up the police and giving you into their custody, whilst my friend here prevents you from escaping?'";
	if the Familiar Count is 7:
		say "I came to myself slowly and painfully[unicode 8212]all my senses dazed. The first thing I saw was Poirot's face. He was sitting opposite me watching me with an anxious face. He gave a cry of joy when he saw me looking at him.

		'Ah, you revive[unicode 8212]you return to yourself. All is well! My friend[unicode 8212]my poor friend!'

		'Where am I?' I said painfully.

		'Where? But chez vous!'

		I looked round me. True enough, I was in the old familiar surroundings. And in the grate were the identical four knobs of coal I had carefully spilt there.

		Poirot had followed my glance.

		'But yes, that was a famous idea of yours[unicode 8212]that and the books. See you, if they should say to me any time. 'That friend of yours, that Hastings, he has not the great brain, is it not so?' I shall reply to them: 'You are in error.' It was an idea magnificent and superb that occurred to you there.'";
	if the Familiar Count is 8:
		say "I must have lost consciousness again for a minute or two. I awoke to find Poirot forcing some brandy between my lips.

		'What is it, mon ami? But what is it[unicode 8212]then? Tell me.' Word by word, I got the thing told, shuddering as I did so. Poirot uttered a cry.

		'My friend! My friend! But what you must have suffered! And I who knew nothing of all this! But reassure yourself! All is well!'

		'You will find her, you mean? But she is in South America. And by the time we get there[unicode 8212]long before, she will be dead[unicode 8212]and God knows how and in what horrible way she will have died.'

		'No, no, you do not understand. She is safe and well. She has never been in their hands for one instant.'

		'But I got a cable from Bronsen?'

		'No, no, you did not. You may have got a cable from South America signed Bronsen[unicode 8212]that is a very different matter. Tell me, has it never occurred to you that an organisation of this kind, with ramifications all over the world, might easily strike at us through that little girl, Cinderella, whom you love so well?'

		'No, never,' I replied.

		'Well, it did to me. I said nothing to you because I did not want to upset you unnecessarily[unicode 8212]but I took measures of my own. Your wife's letters all seem to have been written from the ranch, but in reality she has been in a place of safety devised by me for over three months.'

		I looked at him for a long time.

		'You are sure of that?'

		'Parbleu! I know it. They tortured you with a lie!'

		I turned my head aside. Poirot put his hand on my shoulder. There was something in his voice that I had never heard there before.

		'You like not that I should embrace you or display the emotion, I know well. I will be very British. I will say nothing[unicode 8212]but nothing at all.

		Once clear of the quarry he embraced me with vigour.

		'You are alive[unicode 8212]you are unhurt. It is magnificent. Often have I blamed myself for letting you go.'

		'I'm perfectly all right,' I said, disengaging myself. 'But I'm just a bit fogged. You tumbled to their little scheme, did you?'

		'But I was waiting for it! For what else did I permit you to go there? Your false name, your disguise, not for a moment was it intended to deceive!'

		'What?' I cried. 'You never told me.'

		'As I have frequently told you, Hastings, you have a nature so beautiful and so honest that unless you are yourself deceived, it is impossible for you to deceive others. Good, then, you are spotted from the first, and they do what I had counted on their doing[unicode 8212]a mathematical certainty to any one who uses his grey cells properly[unicode 8212]use you as a decoy.

That, as a matter of fact, it was I who actually precipitated the catastrophe never ceased to fill me with unavailing remorse. It was, as Doctor Ridgeway said, a perfect miracle that I had not been killed, but had escaped with a slight concussion.

		Although it had seemed to me as though I regained consciousness almost immediately, it was in reality over twenty-four hours before I came back to life. It was not until the evening of the day following that I was able to stagger feebly into an adjoining room, and view with deep emotion the plain elm coffin which held the remains of one of the most marvellous men this world has ever known.

		'But Poirot[unicode 8212]why?'

		'A ruse de guerre, my friend, a ruse de guerre. All is now ready for our grand coup.'

		'But you might have told me!'

		'No, Hastings, I could not. Never, never, in a thousand years, could you have acted the part at the funeral. As it was, it was perfect. It could not fail to carry conviction to the Big Four.'

		'Do not think me too unfeeling. I carried out the deception partly for your sake. I was willing to risk my own life, but I had qualms about continually risking yours. So, after the explosion, I have an idea of great brilliancy. The good Ridgeway, he enables me to carry it out. I am dead, you will return to South America. But, mon ami, that is just what you would not do. In the end I have to arrange a solicitor's letter, and a long rigmarole. But, at all events, here you are[unicode 8212]that is the great thing.

I'm not braver than most men. I admit frankly that I was scared to death, and in a blue funk. That Chinese devil meant business, I was sure of that. It was good-bye to the good old world. In spite of myself, my voice wobbled a little as I answered.

'For the last time, no! To hell with your letter!'

Then involuntarily I closed my eyes and breathed a short prayer.";

Now, Captain Hastings, you have still one more part to play. Unless you show yourself he will not enter the house. When he arrives opposite, you must go out on the step and beckon him in.'

'What?' I cried, revolted.

'You play that part alone. Remember the price of failure. If Hercule Poirot suspects anything is amiss and does not enter the house, your wife dies by the Seventy lingering Deaths! Ah! Here he is.'[roman type]

[italic type]I was outside on the steps. I beckoned to Poirot. He hastened across.

'Aha! So all is well with you, my friend. I was beginning to be anxious. You managed to get inside? Is the house empty, then?'

'Yes,' I said, in a voice I strove to make natural. 'There must be a secret way out of it somewhere. Come in and let us look for it.'

I stepped back across the threshold. In all innocence Poirot prepared to follow me.

And then something seemed to snap in my head. I saw only too clearly the part I was playing[unicode 8212]the part of Judas.

'Back, Poirot!' I cried. 'Back for your life. It's a trap. Never mind me. Get away at once.'

Even as I spoke[unicode 8212]or rather shouted my warning hands gripped me like a vice. One of the Chinese servants sprang past me to grab Poirot.

During Hastings[apostrophe] brief absence to fetch you, I have had time to put the bottle in safe keeping. Ah, quick, Hastings, hold him!'

I misunderstood Poirot's anxiety. Eager to save my friend, I flung myself in front of him. But the doctor's swift movement had another meaning. His hand went to his mouth, a smell of bitter almonds filled the air, and he swayed forward and fell.";

		[italic type]'Seems a shame, doesn't it?' said Japp to me as I accompanied him to the door. 'Like robbing a child!'

		I could not help agreeing with a smile. I was still smiling as I re-entered the room.

		'Eh bien!' said Poirot immediately. 'You make fun of Papa Poirot, is it not so?' He shook his finger at me. 'You do not trust his grey cells? Ah, do not be confused! Let us discuss this little problem[unicode 8212]incomplete as yet, I admit, but already showing one or two points of interest.'[roman type]

		'Ah, sacré! But what shall I do with it? I have much remorse! Ce pauvre Japp! Ah, an idea! We will have a little dinner, we three! That consoles me. It was really too easy. I am ashamed.

		Now I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly. I have no patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to night, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a Billingsgate fishwoman blush!

		I looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face, surmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls hid each ear. I judged that she was little more than twenty-two, but her face was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly scarlet.

		Nothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive grimace.

		'Dear me, we've shocked the kind gentleman!' she observed to an imaginary audience. 'I apologize for my language! Most unladylike, and all that, but Oh, Lord, there's reason enough for it! Do you know I've lost my only sister?'

		'Say no more! Nobody loves me! I shall go into the garden and eat worms! Boohoo! I am crushed!'

		She buried herself behind a large comic French paper. In a minute or two I saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top. In spite of myself I could not help smiling, and in a minute she had tossed the paper aside, and had burst into a merry peal of laughter.

		'I knew you weren't such a mutt as you looked,' she cried.

[if Hercule Poirot is unclaimed]On the third one I read the words 'Last Will and Testament'. I was shocked into a sudden sense of gravity.

[italic type][one of]On arrival in London, I deposited my luggage at an hotel and drove straight on to the old address. What poignant memories it brought back to me! I hardly waited to greet my old landlady, but hurried up the stairs two at a time and rapped on Poirot's door.

'Enter, then,' cried a familiar voice from within.

I strode in. Poirot stood facing me. In his arms he carried a small valise, which he dropped with a crash on beholding me.

'Mon ami, Hastings!' he cried. 'Mon ami, Hastings!'

And, rushing forward, he enveloped me in a capacious embrace. Our conversation was incoherent and inconsequent. Ejaculations, eager questions, incomplete answers, messages from my wife, explanations as to my journey, were all jumbled up together.

'I suppose there's some one in my old rooms?' I asked at last, when we had calmed down somewhat. 'I'd love to put up here again with you.'

Poirot's face changed with startling suddenness.

'Mon Dieu! but what a chance épouvantable. Regard around you, my friend.'

For the first time I took note of my surroundings. Against the wall stood a vast ark of a trunk of prehistoric design. Near to it were placed a number of suit-cases, ranged neatly in order of size from large to small. The inference was unmistakable.

'You are going away?'

'Yes.'

'Where to?'

'South America.'

'What?'

'Yes, it is a droll farce, is it not? It is to Rio I go, and every day I say to myself, I will write nothing in my letters[unicode 8212]but oh! the surprise of the good Hastings when he beholds me!'
[or]He pushed me into a chair.

'Come, I will tell you how it all came about. Do you know who is the richest man in the world? Richer even than Rockefeller? Abe Ryland.'

'The American Soap King?'

'Precisely. One of his secretaries approached me. There is some very considerable, as you would call it, hocus-pocus going on in connection with a big company in Rio. He wished me to investigate matters on the spot. I refused. I told him that if the facts were laid before me, I would give him my expert opinion. But that he professed himself unable to do. I was to be put in possession of the facts only on my arrival out there. Normally, that would have closed the matter. To dictate to Hercule Poirot is sheer impertinence. But the sum offered was so stupendous that for the first time in my life I was tempted by mere money. It was a competence[unicode 8212]a fortune! And there was a second attraction[unicode 8212]you, my friend. For this last year and a half I have been a very lonely old man. I thought to myself, Why not? I am beginning to weary of this unending solving of foolish problems. I have achieved sufficient fame. Let me take this money and settle down somewhere near my old friend.'

I was quite affected by this token of Poirot's regard.
[or]'Put very delicately,' said Poirot, nodding his head. 'And supposing I[unicode 8212]accept?'

'In that case I am empowered to offer you[unicode 8212]compensation.'

He drew out a pocket-book, and threw ten notes on the table. They were for ten thousand francs each.

'That is merely as a guarantee of our good faith,' he said. 'Ten times that amount will be paid you.'

'Good God,' I cried, springing up, 'you dare to think[unicode 8212]!'

'Sit down, Hastings,' said Poirot autocratically. 'Subdue your so beautiful and honest nature and sit down. To you, monsieur, I will say this. What is to prevent me ringing up the police and giving you into their custody, whilst my friend here prevents you from escaping?'
[or]I came to myself slowly and painfully[unicode 8212]all my senses dazed. The first thing I saw was Poirot's face. He was sitting opposite me watching me with an anxious face. He gave a cry of joy when he saw me looking at him.

'Ah, you revive[unicode 8212]you return to yourself. All is well! My friend[unicode 8212]my poor friend!'

'Where am I?' I said painfully.

'Where? But chez vous!'

I looked round me. True enough, I was in the old familiar surroundings. And in the grate were the identical four knobs of coal I had carefully spilt there.

Poirot had followed my glance.

'But yes, that was a famous idea of yours[unicode 8212]that and the books. See you, if they should say to me any time. 'That friend of yours, that Hastings, he has not the great brain, is it not so?' I shall reply to them: 'You are in error.' It was an idea magnificent and superb that occurred to you there.'
[or]I must have lost consciousness again for a minute or two. I awoke to find Poirot forcing some brandy between my lips.

'What is it, mon ami? But what is it[unicode 8212]then? Tell me.' Word by word, I got the thing told, shuddering as I did so. Poirot uttered a cry.

'My friend! My friend! But what you must have suffered! And I who knew nothing of all this! But reassure yourself! All is well!'

'You will find her, you mean? But she is in South America. And by the time we get there[unicode 8212]long before, she will be dead[unicode 8212]and God knows how and in what horrible way she will have died.'

'No, no, you do not understand. She is safe and well. She has never been in their hands for one instant.'

'But I got a cable from Bronsen?'

'No, no, you did not. You may have got a cable from South America signed Bronsen[unicode 8212]that is a very different matter. Tell me, has it never occurred to you that an organisation of this kind, with ramifications all over the world, might easily strike at us through that little girl, Cinderella, whom you love so well?'

'No, never,' I replied.

'Well, it did to me. I said nothing to you because I did not want to upset you unnecessarily[unicode 8212]but I took measures of my own. Your wife's letters all seem to have been written from the ranch, but in reality she has been in a place of safety devised by me for over three months.'

I looked at him for a long time.

'You are sure of that?'

'Parbleu! I know it. They tortured you with a lie!'

I turned my head aside. Poirot put his hand on my shoulder. There was something in his voice that I had never heard there before.

'You like not that I should embrace you or display the emotion, I know well. I will be very British. I will say nothing[unicode 8212]but nothing at all. Only this[unicode 8212]that in this last adventure of ours, the honours are all with you, and happy is the man who has such a friend as I have!'[cycling]" instead;

'You are on the[unicode 8212]how do you say it?[unicode 8212]get-rich-quick tack, eh, mon ami?'

'Well, look at this last coup, the million dollars[apostrophe] worth of Liberty Bonds which the London and Scottish Bank were sending to New York, and which disappeared in such a remarkable manner on board the Olympia.'

'If it were not for the mal de mer, and the difficulty of practising the so excellent method of Laverguier for a longer time than the few hours of crossing the channel, I should delight to voyage myself on one of these big liners,' murmured Poirot dreamily.[roman type]
[or][italic type]'A la bonne heure, Hastings. You use your grey cells at last. Now for a little surprise for Japp.'

Softly unbolting the door, he stuck the cat's head round the edge and ejaculated a piercing 'Miaow.'

The Scotland Yard inspector, who was standing outside with another man, jumped in spite of himself.

'Oh, it's only Monsieur Poirot at one of his little jokes!' he exclaimed, as Poirot's head followed that of the cat. 'Let us in, moosior.'[roman type]
[or][italic type]Somewhat crestfallen, I returned to London. I found Poirot established in an arm-chair by the fire in a garish, silk dressing-gown. He greeted me with much affection.

'Mon ami Hastings! But how glad I am to see you. Veritably I have for you a great affection. And you have enjoyed yourself? You have run to and fro with the good Japp? You have interrogated and investigated to your heart's content?'

'Poirot,' I cried, 'the thing's a dark mystery! It will never be solved.'

'It is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over it.'

'No, indeed. It's a hard nut to crack.'

'Oh, as far as that goes, I am very good at cracking the nuts! A veritable squirrel! It is not that which embarrasses me. I know well enough who killed Mr. Harrington Pace.'[roman type]
[or][italic type]'You don't mean to say, Monsieur Poirot, that you would undertake to solve a case without moving from your chair, do you?'

'That is exactly what I do mean[unicode 8212]granted the facts were placed before me. I regard myself as a consulting specialist.'

Japp slapped his knee. 'Hanged if I don't take you at your word. Bet you a fiver that you can't lay your hand[unicode 8212]or rather tell me where to lay my hand[unicode 8212]on Mr. Davenheim, dead or alive, before a week is out.'

Poirot considered. 'Eh bien, mon ami, I accept. Le sport, it is the passion of you English. Now[unicode 8212]the facts.'[roman type]

(I skimmed ahead.)

[italic type]'Seems a shame, doesn't it?' said Japp to me as I accompanied him to the door. 'Like robbing a child!'

I could not help agreeing with a smile. I was still smiling as I re-entered the room.

'Eh bien!' said Poirot immediately. 'You make fun of Papa Poirot, is it not so?' He shook his finger at me. 'You do not trust his grey cells? Ah, do not be confused! Let us discuss this little problem[unicode 8212]incomplete as yet, I admit, but already showing one or two points of interest.'[roman type]

(I skimmed ahead.)

[italic type]'It's impossible,' murmured Japp.

'Ask Madame,' said my friend, smiling.

The next day a registered letter lay beside Poirot's plate. He opened it, and a five-pound note fluttered out. My friend's brow puckered.

'Ah, sacré! But what shall I do with it? I have much remorse! Ce pauvre Japp! Ah, an idea! We will have a little dinner, we three! That consoles me. It was really too easy. I am ashamed. I, who would not rob a child[unicode 8212]mille tonnerres! Mon ami, what have you, that you laugh so heartily?'[roman type]
[or][italic type]Up till then I had hardly noticed my companion, but I was now violently recalled to the fact of her existence. Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck her head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible ejaculation 'Hell!'

Now I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly. I have no patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to night, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a Billingsgate fishwoman blush!

I looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face, surmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls hid each ear. I judged that she was little more than twenty-two, but her face was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly scarlet.

Nothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive grimace.

'Dear me, we've shocked the kind gentleman!' she observed to an imaginary audience. 'I apologize for my language! Most unladylike, and all that, but Oh, Lord, there's reason enough for it! Do you know I've lost my only sister?'

'Really?' I said politely. 'How unfortunate.'

'He disapproves!' remarked the lady. 'He disapproves utterly[unicode 8212]of me, and my sister[unicode 8212]which last is unfair, because he hasn't seen her!'

I opened my mouth, but she forestalled me.

'Say no more! Nobody loves me! I shall go into the garden and eat worms! Boohoo! I am crushed!'

She buried herself behind a large comic French paper. In a minute or two I saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top. In spite of myself I could not help smiling, and in a minute she had tossed the paper aside, and had burst into a merry peal of laughter.

'I knew you weren't such a mutt as you looked,' she cried.

Her laughter was so infectious that I could not help joining in, though I hardly cared for the word 'mutt.' The girl was certainly all that I most disliked, but that was no reason why I should make myself ridiculous by my attitude. I prepared to unbend. After all, she was decidedly pretty...[roman type]

I felt an odd pull between wanting to smile and to weep, as was often the case with memories of Cinders. We had been so young, then... It had felt to me back on that train in France, already well past thirty, that I could not possibly be more mature. I thought myself worldly[unicode 8212]which I suppose was not untrue, at least[unicode 8212]and fancied that I knew my own mind and heart to the fullest. How naive I was!

Melancholy threatened to overtake me as I replaced the book on the shelf[unicode 8212]I shifted my thoughts to the happy times we had spent together, and all that I had learned in my relationship with this exceptional woman. I knew that she would want me to be happy.[cycling]" instead;

What I have kept from the press, however, is the details of my family's repatriation and the profound impact it has had on all of our lives.

Un à la fois!'[roman type] whilst he smoothed out the wrinkles they had inflicted on his clothes.[paragraph break]     As was his habit, he sat them around the table clockwise from tallest to shortest, leaving the chair at his right side for me. The food was succulent as always and elicited compliments from around the table which made Poirot preen and purr.[paragraph break]     By the meal's end the children had extracted from him promises of handcrafted mysteries, private tutoring, personalized desserts and even Monopoly lessons. My little friend had never been more in demand since the height of his career.

I liked Poirot to be sporting in his mysteries, and felt a petty need to take him to task.[paragraph break]     Once more I extended the plate, which I had so exhaustively scrubbed that it could not possibly fail to meet Poirot's standards again. When my friend failed to take it from my hand, I turned to find his hazel eyes fixed on me in twinkling amusement. 'Come now, Hastings[unicode 8212]have you not succeeded in proving yourself with this little case? I pray of you, do not enrage yourself!'[paragraph break]     His tone suggested that he considered my forgiveness a foregone conclusion, and I felt my cold façade crumbling under the weight of his earnestly expectant gaze. My involuntary smile did not escape his notice. His air of blithe satisfaction as he puffed out his chest and went back to work caused me to burst out in laughter despite myself, and our conversation continued in good humour as we finished cleaning up.[else]It was only midway through washing the dishes that a feeling of great offense suddenly smote me.[paragraph break]     'Poirot!

Robert was already curled up under the sheets, rabbit in hand and Bob at the foot of his bed, while Thomas was engrossed in [italic type]The Big Four[roman type] and had to be coaxed to put it away. I came out of their room just in time for the end of Poirot's story.[paragraph break]     '[italic type]Ils vécurent heureux et eurent beaucoup d'enfants.[roman type]' He walked out soon after.

My friend appeared to share my contemplative mood and was gazing out the window with a dreamy expression.[paragraph break]     Looking at this extraordinary man who had supported and cared for us through these harrowing times, I suddenly felt remiss.[paragraph break]     'Thank you,' I blurted out.[paragraph break]     He turned to me, looking confused. 'What for, [italic type]mon ami[roman type]?'[paragraph break]     I was wrong-footed. 'For[unicode 8212]well[unicode 8212]you know. All of your help, and your patience with the children[unicode 8212]'[paragraph break]     Poirot raised a hand, mercifully putting an end to my floundering.[paragraph break]     '[italic type]Non, non,[roman type]' he implored. His vehemence surprised me. 'It is I who should thank you.

It pained me to hear Poirot call himself old[unicode 8212]it seemed an indirect attack on my own bygone youth.[paragraph break]     My friend loves to be mysterious; any intriguing crumbs of information he deigns to hand out often serve the sole purpose of inviting admiration and interest in his genius. For once I got the impression that he was not playing coy, but was genuinely embarrassed. This only aroused my curiosity further.[paragraph break]     Sensing that I had no intention of letting the matter slide, Poirot relented with a sigh and picked up where he had left off. 'Do you know,' he started, gazing deeply into his [italic type]sirop de cassis[roman type], 'that the day we began our war on the Big Four is one that I have regretted most bitterly?'[paragraph break]     I stared at him, uncomprehending. 'Regretted? But we had a near-flawless victory! You called it [apostrophe]the great case of your life[apostrophe]!'[paragraph break]     He smiled a touch ruefully. 'Perhaps. But often and often I have wondered what could have been. When you returned from your ranch to visit, you will recall, I was on my way to retire to South America. Then the Big Four[unicode 8212]the reveal of their plans[unicode 8212]our adventures over these many months[unicode 8212]and when it was all finished, the opportunity had passed... instead, I resigned myself to attempt to grow the vegetable marrows again, here in England.

And they are unutterably dear to me[unicode 8212]as is their father.'[paragraph break]     It was now my turn to gaze into my drink, and I felt myself flush. I had never been much good at emotional conversations and was already feeling another fluster coming on.[paragraph break]     'Thomas won't stop talking about you, you know,' I offered. 'I'm afraid that someday I'll find him parting his hair in the middle just to impress you!'[paragraph break]     Poirot gave a loud, gleeful laugh.[paragraph break]     'Ah, there is hope for the boy yet[unicode 8212]unlike his father! But I admit it, the un-symmetrical style, it suits you after all. And the grey at your temples[unicode 8212][italic type]très distingué[roman type]!'[paragraph break]     I was caught between the pleasure of the praise and the embarrassment of my hair being discussed at all.
